xrToolkit it's a X-Ray Engine SDK addon designed to offer multiple tools and upgrades with the goal of improving work flow and making some aspects of the "daily work" easir.

This program merges and unifies multiple S.T.A.L.K.E.R. modding tools to offer a easir, quicker and better experience for making mods, forget about having multiple folders, files and executables lying around your computer.

Developed on C# and using WPF framework for UI.
